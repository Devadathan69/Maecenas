    evidenceText:
      "Gateway nanopayments convert a protected HTTP resource into a price-aware service. An agent requests a resource, receives a 402 challenge, attaches a payment authorization, and retries to unlock the response. The important design shift is that the agent can evaluate each request independently, which fits research workflows where only a subset of sources deserve paid access.",

Instead of hiding monetization behind dashboards and subscriptions, a server can return pricing, recipient, and network metadata at request time. This lets autonomous clients decide whether the marginal value of one API call or evidence unlock exceeds its quoted price.",
